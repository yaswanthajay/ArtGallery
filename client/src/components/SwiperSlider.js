      description: "Peacock paintings hold significant importance in Vastu and Feng Shui. In Vastu, a peacock painting is believed to attract positive energy, bringing prosperity, harmony, and peace to the home. The vibrant colors and regal presence of the peacock symbolize beauty and grace, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and uplifting the mood. In Feng Shui, the peacock represents dignity, love, and prosperity. Placing a peacock painting in the living room or entrance can invite auspicious energy, fostering a balanced and harmonious environment.",

      description: "Spray paint (formally aerosol paint) is paint that comes in a sealed, pressurized container and is released in an aerosol spray when a valve button is depressed. The propellant is what the container of pressurized gas is called. When the pressure holding the gas is released through the valve, the aerosol paint releases as a fine spray.[1] Aerosol painting is one form of spray painting; it leaves a smooth, even coat, unlike many traditional rolled and brushed paints. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.",
